# Object Literals and the Brackets Notation

By the end of this reading, you'll be able to:

- Explain how to build objects using the brackets notation
- Explain that with the brackets notation you can use the space character inside keys, since property keys are strings
- Explain that the keys inside the brackets notation are evaluated

## Object literals and the brackets notation

There is an alternative syntax to the dot notation I used up until this point.

This alternative syntax is known as the *brackets notation*.

To understand how it works, it's best to use an example, so I'll go through the process of coding the house2 object again, in the same way that I did with the dot notation, only this time, I'll use the brackets notation.

```javascript
var house2 = {};
house2["rooms"] = 4;
house2['color']= "pink";
house2["priceUSD"] = 12345;
console.log(house2); // {rooms: 4, color: 'pink', priceUSD: 12345}
```

Note that using the brackets notation, I essentially just wrap each property's key **as a string**, inside either the single or double quotes - just like with regular strings.

Then I wrap the entire property key into an opening and a closing square bracket.

That's essentially all there is to it.

I can both access and update properties on objects using either the dot notation, or the brackets notation, or a combination of both, like in the following example:

```javascript
var car = {};
car.color = "red";
car["color"] = "green";
car["speed"] = 200;
car.speed = 100;
console.log(car); // {color: "green", speed: 100}
```

For the time being, this is probably enough information on object creation.

Before I discuss the topic of arrays and objects, let me just give you another important piece of information about the brackets notation.

With the brackets notation, I can add space characters inside property names, like this:  

```javascript
car["number of doors"] = 4;
console.log(car); // {color: 'green', speed: 100, number of doors: 4}
```

Additionally, I can add numbers (as the string data type) as property keys:  

```javascript
car["2022"] = 1901;
console.log(car); // {2022: 1901, color: 'green', speed: 100, number of doors: 4}
```

However, doing this is discouraged, due to obvious reasons of having a property key as a number string not really conveying a lot of useful information.

Finally, there's one really useful thing that bracket notation has but is not available in the dot notation: **It can evaluate expressions**.

To understand what that means, consider the following example:

```javascript
var arrOfKeys = ['speed', 'altitude', 'color'];
var drone = {
    speed: 100,
    altitude: 200,
    color: "red"
}
for (var i = 0; i < arrOfKeys.length; i++) {
    console.log(drone[arrOfKeys[i]])
}
```

The above code will result in the following output:  

```
100
200
red
```

Using the fact that brackets notation can evaluate expressions, I accessed the arrOfKeys[i] property on the drone object.

This value changed on each loop while the for loop was running.

Specifically, the first time it ran, it was evaluated like this:

- The value of i was 0
- The value of arrOfKeys[i] was arrOfKeys[0], which was "speed"
- Thus, drone[arrOfKeys[i]] was evaluated to drone["speed"] which is equal to 100

This allowed me to loop over each of the values stored inside the drone object, based on each of its properties' keys.
