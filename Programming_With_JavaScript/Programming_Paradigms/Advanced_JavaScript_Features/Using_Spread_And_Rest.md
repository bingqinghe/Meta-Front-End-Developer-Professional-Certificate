# Using Spread and Rest

In this reading, you'll learn how to join arrays and objects using the spread operator.

You will also discover how to use the spread operator to:

- Add new members to arrays without using the push() method
- Convert a string to an array 
- Copy either an object or an array into a separate object 

Recall that the push() and pop() methods are used to add and remove items from the end of an array.

## Notes on using the rest operator

By using the rest operator, you can gather multiple elements into a single array or object. It's useful for handling remaining items in destructuring or collecting arguments in functions.

For example, in array destructuring:

```javascript
const [first, ...rest] = [1, 2, 3, 4];

console.log(first); // 1
console.log(rest);  // [2, 3, 4]
```

Or in a function to collect arguments:

```javascript
function sum(...numbers) {
    return numbers.reduce((total, num) => total + num, 0);
}

console.log(sum(1, 2, 3)); // 6
```

## Differences between spread and rest operators

### Spread Operator

- Expands arrays, objects, or strings into individual elements or properties.
- Used for concatenation, copying, or passing arguments.

### Rest Operator

- Gathers multiple elements into a single array or object.
- Used in destructuring or collecting function arguments.

## Join arrays and objects using the spread operator

Using the spread operator, it's easy to concatenate arrays:

```javascript
const fruits = ['apple', 'pear', 'plum'];
const berries = ['blueberry', 'strawberry'];
const fruitsAndBerries = [...fruits, ...berries]; // concatenate
console.log(fruitsAndBerries); // outputs a single array
```

Here's the result:  

```javascript
['apple', 'pear', 'plum', 'blueberry', 'strawberry'];
```

It's also easy to join objects:  

```javascript
const flying = { wings: 2 };
const car = { wheels: 4 };
const flyingCar = {...flying, ...car};
console.log(flyingCar); // {wings: 2, wheels: 4}
```

## Add new members to arrays without using the push() method

Here's how to use the spread operator to easily add one or more members to an existing array:

```javascript
let veggies = ['onion', 'parsley'];
veggies = [...veggies, 'carrot', 'beetroot'];
console.log(veggies);
```

Here's the output:

```javascript
['onion', 'parsley', 'carrot', 'beetroot'];
```

## Convert a string to an array using the spread operator

Given a string, it's easy to spread it out into separate array items:

```javascript
const greeting = "Hello";
const arrayOfChars = [...greeting];
console.log(arrayOfChars); // Â ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
```

## Copy either an object or an array into a separate one

Here's how to copy an object into a completely separate object, using the spread operator.

```javascript
const car1 = {
    speed: 200,
    color: 'yellow'
}
const car2 = {...car1};

car1.speed = 201;

console.log(car1.speed, car2.speed);
```

The output is 201, 200.

You can copy an array into a completely separate array, also using the spread operator, like this:

```javascript
const fruits1 = ['apples', 'pears'];
const fruits2 = [...fruits1];
fruits1.pop();
console.log(fruits1, "not", fruits2);
```

This time, the output is:

```javascript
['apples'] 'not' ['apples','pears'];
```

Note that the spread operator only performs a shallow copy of the source array or object. For more information on this, please refer to the additional reading.

There are many more tricks that you can perform with the spread operator. Some of them are really useful when you start working with a library such as React.
